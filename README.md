# Bike-Sharing Usage Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike-sharing usage trends between two user groups: casual users and members. The data reveals seasonal trends, preferred days of the week for riding, and bike type preferences. Based on this analysis, we propose strategies to convert casual users into members.

## Background
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at **Cyclistic**, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes that the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team aims to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. Before proceeding, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, which will be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Characters and Teams
- **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-sharing more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes, while about 8% of riders use assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

- **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for developing campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program, including email, social media, and other channels.

- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team**: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that guides Cyclistic's marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals, as well as how I can help Cyclistic achieve them.

- **Cyclistic Executive Team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy has relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that has facilitated this is the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although pricing flexibility helps attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign targeting all-new customers, Moreno sees a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 

She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the historical bike trip data of Cyclistic to identify trends.
