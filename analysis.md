The high usage of electric bikes among both member and casual users suggests a preference for the convenience and speed they offer, especially for longer trips. Classic bikes remain a staple.

Member usage aligns with a weekday commuting pattern, while casual users are more active on weekends, likely for leisure purposes.

## AVG trip length:

Casuals take double the longer trips, meaning weekend leisure trips vs members - to work/other quick rides

## AVG trip length per month:

Casual users consistently have longer average trip durations compared to members, with the highest trip length seen during the summer months (June, July, and August). This aligns with expected patterns where warm-weather months see more recreational use, particularly from casual riders.

## Most active month:

The data indicates that summer is the most active season for rides, with July being the peak month. Casual users are more seasonal in their usage, heavily favoring the summer months, while members maintain more steady activity across the year.

# Strategies for Converting Casual Riders to Annual Memberships



## 1. Offer Seasonal Membership Discounts for Casual Users
Since casual users are more active during summer, a time-limited discount for membership that starts just before summer could be enticing. This could take the form of a "Summer Pass" or a discounted annual membership for those who subscribe during the peak summer months. Highlight the benefits of membership, such as lower per-ride costs, increased availability, and priority access to electric bikes, which align with casual users' preferences for longer, leisurely trips.
## 2. Introduce a Flexible Membership Tier with Perks for Longer Trips
Casual users tend to take longer trips on weekends, likely for leisure. Creating a membership tier that specifically includes perks for longer rides (e.g., a certain number of hours of ride time per month, or free ride time on weekends) could appeal to these users. Additionally, offering an introductory trial membership or a "Weekend Warrior" plan, which includes benefits like a set number of weekend or summer rides, can help casual users experience the benefits of being a member without a full commitment upfront.
## 3. Promote Exclusive Electric Bike Perks for Members
Given the high usage of electric bikes among casual users, promoting member-only perks such as discounted rates or priority access to electric bikes can be a strong incentive. Casual riders who prefer electric bikes may find the added convenience and reduced cost of electric bike usage compelling. Ride-sharing services could emphasize these exclusive benefits through targeted marketing campaigns, particularly at the start of the summer season when casual users are more engaged with the service.
